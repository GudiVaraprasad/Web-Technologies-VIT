      Warangal is a city in the Indian state of Telangana. It is the second
      largest city in Telangana with a population of 830,281 per 2011 Census of
      India, and spreading over an 406 km2 (157 sq mi). Warangal served as the
      capital of the Kakatiya dynasty which was established in 1163. The
      monuments left by the Kakatiyas include fortresses, lakes, temples and
      stone gateways which, in the present, helped the city to become a popular
      tourist attraction. The Kakatiya Kala Thoranam was included in the emblem
      of Telangana by the state government and Warangal is also touted as the
      cultural capital of Telangana.

      for the Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana scheme by the
      Government of India. It was also selected as a smart city in the

      under the Smart Cities Mission. The three urban cities Kazipet, Hanamkonda
      and Warangal are together known as Warangal Tri-City. The three cities are
